#         Installation of S4_pyext in Red Hat systems (tested in Fedora 38)
#
#
# The packages liblua-devel, fftw3-devel and suitesparse-devel are indispensible for the installation of S4_pyext
# Although we are using the Python interface, we still need to install liblua-devel
# For ancient versions of Fedora and CentOS (CentOS <= 7), we should use yum instead of dnf 

# Enter the super user mode (type the password). You can use sudo instead in case where you do not activate the root account 
su 

# Install lapack and blas if you do not have these packages in your computer. Note that blas and blas-devel are dependencies of lapack and lapack-devel so they are installed when we install the latter ones 
dnf install lapack 
dnf install lapack-devel 

# Install numpy, scipy, matplotlib if you do not have these Python packages in your computer 
dnf install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib 

# Install liblua-devel, current version (19/9/2023): lua-devel-5.4
dnf install lua-devel 

# Install fftw3-devel, current version (19/9/2023): fftw3-devel-3.3
dnf install fftw3-devel

# Install suitesparse-devel, current version (19/9/2023): suitesparse-devel-4.0.2
dnf install suitesparse-devel

# You may need to install OPENBLAS, LAPACK if you don't have these libraries in your computer

# Once you install all the required packages, exit the superuser (root) mode. Otherwise, you take the risk of being unable to use and modify the S4 folder
exit 

# Clone the S4_pyext package from the Phoebe repository 
git clone https://github.com/phoebe-p/S4

# Enter to the S4 directory
cd S4

# Make 
make boost           # make boost is essential . At this step, do not make lib as in the documentation of Victor Liu 
make S4_pyext  

# We successfully install S4_pyext, now we can import S4 as a library to Python
# by using the following command at the beginning of the program 
import S4 as S4
